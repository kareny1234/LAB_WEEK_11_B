LAB WEEK 11 – PART 3
Photo and Video using FileProvider and MediaStore

1. When a user takes a picture, that picture is stored in a path based on the given URI. 
   In which part of the code handles this? (Copy that part of the code as the answer)

The part of the code that handles storing the picture based on the given URI is when the 
camera result is launched using ActivityResultContracts and the URI generated by 
FileProvider is passed to it.

Code snippet:

photoFile = File(getExternalFilesDir("Pictures"), "img_${System.currentTimeMillis()}.jpg")
val uri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(
    this,
    "com.example.lab_week_11_b.camera",
    photoFile
)
photoLauncher.launch(uri)

This code determines the file path, generates a content URI using FileProvider, and 
launches the camera activity so the captured photo is stored at that location.


2. In your FileInfo.kt, there are 5 attributes. 
   On the first attribute, what does the URI refer to? 
   And on the fourth attribute, what does relativePath refer to?

The first attribute (uri) refers to the content URI that represents the file location 
and is used to grant temporary access permission to other applications, such as the 
Camera app, to read or write the file.

The fourth attribute (relativePath) refers to the directory path where the file will be 
stored inside the external storage, such as Pictures or Movies, which determines where 
the file appears in the Gallery or MediaStore.


3. [Bonus] Explain the chronological order from when a user takes a picture until the 
   file is stored in the MediaStore.

First, the user presses the Photo button in the application.
Second, the application generates a File object and a corresponding content URI using 
FileProvider.
Third, the camera activity is launched using ActivityResultContracts.TakePicture() with 
the generated URI.
Fourth, the user takes a picture using the camera application.
Fifth, the camera application saves the captured image into the file location specified 
by the URI.
Finally, the file is stored in external storage and indexed by the system, making it 
accessible through the Gallery or MediaStore.
